- Debugging code is hairy
- C++ style comments
- C99 declarations of variables
- Breakage for 3rd party extension modules
- int -> Py_ssize_t in many spots http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/
- graphs "need" error bars

- build a distutils package or egg, put on PyPI, announce on
  comp.lang.python.announce
- Write PEP
  - Raymond: extension module -> 2.6 -> reconsider for p3k if popular
- reversed iterator not yet implemented
- TimSort not implemented for large lists

Known bugs:

- Not robust to strange __del__ operations
- Not robust to out-of-memory errors in all places
- May not be robust to trying to create lists larger than PY_SSIZE_T_MAX
- repr()/str() may not be robust to list mutation
- speedtest uses make instead of setup.py

Optimizations:

- non-user blist should use a better tp_new
- use copyref() in blist_become

Cleanup:

- Make macros into inline function where possible
