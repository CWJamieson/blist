- Breakage for 3rd party extension modules
- graphs "need" error bars
- Write PEP
  - Raymond: extension module -> 2.6 -> reconsider for p3k if popular
- reversed iterator not yet implemented
- TimSort not implemented for large lists

Known bugs:

- Not robust to out-of-memory errors in all places
- May not be robust to trying to create lists larger than PY_SSIZE_T_MAX
- speedtest uses make instead of setup.py

Optimizations:



Cleanup:


C API:

- PySequence_Fast must convert BLists to tuples
- Over-allocation tricks in stringobject.c no longer work
- PyList_Fini() commented out
-             #self.assertRaises(MemoryError, list, xrange(sys.maxint // 2))


test_descr - OK
test_descrtut - OK
test_iterlen - OK, modifying during iteration
test_itertools - OK, modifying during iteration
test_list - OK
test_resource - also fails with listobject
test_sort - doesn't always detect modifications during sort
test_userlist - OK
