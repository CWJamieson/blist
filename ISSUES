- Breakage for 3rd party extension modules
- TimSort not implemented for large lists

Known bugs:

- Not robust to out-of-memory errors in all places
- May not be robust to trying to create lists larger than PY_SSIZE_T_MAX
- speedtest uses make instead of setup.py

Optimizations:



Cleanup:


C API:

- PySequence_Fast must convert BLists to tuples
- Over-allocation tricks in stringobject.c no longer work
- PyList_Fini() commented out
-             #self.assertRaises(MemoryError, list, xrange(sys.maxint // 2))

test_itertools - OK, modifying during iteration
test_list - OK
test_resource - also fails with listobject
test_sort - doesn't always detect modifications during sort
